                          <h1>Philips Fully Automatic Espresso Maker</h1>
                          <p>Philips has made a reasonably priced fully automatic coffee makers for the consumers that are an investment but won't break the bank. You can have great coffee for the price. The more expensive coffee machines obviously can make your espressos better - or you could by learning the craft instead of going for automated machines. But if you're just getting into the world of espressos and don't know how to make them yourself, the fancier or make-it-yourself versions may seem daunting.</p>
						  <p>This is a great beginner coffee maker that saves you money in the long run since you won't be running to the coffee shops for every espresso or latte. Great for those of us who work from home, like yours truly. You can adjust the coarseness of the grind, water amount, water temperature, amount of beans and the amount of milk for those that like the coffee drinks. It's pretty versatile with it's functions but you'll most likely need to play around a bit before finding you optimal cup.</p>
						  <p>You can choose between the version that has the automatic milk frother vs the wand. And there is the option to use ground beans but in all honesty *why would you* when you have the automatic coffee grinder. All you'll essentially need to do is press the button - although possibly a couple times depending on how full you want your coffee flavor to be as the limitations of the settings come up and the quality is not the same of a baristas.</p>
						  <p>Still, a solid machine that will get you your coffee fix so easily even a child could do it. As you progress into more bean varieties and the art of coffee you may want to splurge for a higher end machine that would allow you to craft them yourself - but then again maybe not. At this point I honestly like the convenience, the multiple coffee drink options - but in all honesty what I really love is the coffee! It does pull a very respectable shot of espresso. </p>
						  <p>The machine in the image is the 3200 series with the LatteGo Milk frother, but essentially any of them from basics of 1200 series, 2200 series to 5400 series will provide you with what you need. The differences lie in the automations and coffee drink options.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Regarding the coffee options the 3200 series can make you Espresso, hot water, cappuccino, coffee, latte macchiato and americano. The 2200 series is the same machine except it doesn't make latte macchiato or americano. The water filter helps keep the machine clean and the clening itself isn't too hard either. The coffee grinder has several settings, 12 in fact for the 3200 series - along with the other settings options I have already mentioned.</p>

                                <h5 class="card-title">Brewing and maintenance</h5>
                                <p class="card-text">After completing the setup steps for your coffee maker all you really need to do is select your cup of coffee and whether you want a single or a double, and press the on button. If you want let's say a triple that you'll need to add after your double has brewed. You need to keep the bottom tray from overflowing and empty the discarded pucks, keep the water filled and ensure the beans are flowing nicely. That's your day to day maintenance. I follow a weekly routine too, which it's hard either. I'll elaborate another day</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Now after the rant I had on the main page about beans you probably thought I was done with the subject - alas no, I am not. As I mentioned, with espresso makers a darker roast goes better. My rant wouldn't be complete without me mentioning my current quilty pleasure - <a href="https://koacoffee.com/p/pure-kona-coffee/estate-dark-roast-whole-bean-kona">Koa Coffee Estate Dark Roast Private Reserve</a> Every bean i've tried from them is great but this is my daily favorite  and one I keep restocking for my morning and afternoon brew.</p>
