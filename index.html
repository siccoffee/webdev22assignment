                          <p>One who also claims to be somewhat of a coffee connoisseur. Or actually I may be more of a dedicated fan. Whether the terminology fits me, I'll leave for you to decide my fellow coffee lovers - or haters. No judgement here although it makes me wonder why you stumbled onto my page.</p>
						  <p>Not all caffeine is created equal. There are multitude of aspects that create a great cup of joe. The technical aspects naturally count but so does the experience and your own state of mind. </p>
						  <p>Are you the type of person that takes a break while having coffee and thinks about anything and everything; one that takes their cup on the run when it's a habit or necessity instead of enjoyment; or possibly one that does both based on the quality of the cuppa they're enjoying, their location and possibly time of day. </p>
						  <p>Here I'll be discussing a bit about the areas that make a great cup of coffee instead of just a good one - to me.

The coffee maker should have a good pressure in putting the water through, usually 8-15bar. More isn't necessarily better in this scenario, a great coffee maker will be able to brew you a wonderful cup of espresso with even 7 bars.</p>

                          <h1>Beans!</h1>
                          <p>I'll get into the technique later but let us discuss coffee beans. </p>
						  <p>This is something that could be talked about for hours without really reaching a conclusion as personal preferences and opinions can't really be argued about. </p>
						  <p>There are some main points that can guide you to the right direction in finding your favorite beans as you have some control/choice over the matter.</p>
                          <p>Let's start with where might one find good coffee beans. Your safest option is to roast them yourself or find a great local roaster. I would implore you to stay away from roasted grocery store beans mainly due to their freshness or lack there-of. Even the "freshest" options are often several months old.</p>
						  <p>The next area of importance is knowing what you will be having and what you will be brewing it with. Obviously, you'll need to play around to find your preferences in the grind size, bar (which fall under technique) and bean itself - but there are alternatives that work better with different types of brewing methods. For example you will need to look for something darker to get the flavor out in a french press vs a lighter bean might work better with a cold brew coffee. </p>
						  <p>Play around with the flavor notes! Fruity, chocolatey, something more exotic - or possibly something more heavily flavored like the seasonal pumpkin spice during fall. There's also great decaf beans available for those more sensitive to caffeine.</p>
						  <p>My personal guidelines are that I prefer a darker, heavier flavor profile if adding milk to the drink and a lighter bean with a flavor profile that excites me if having espresso or pour over.
						  <p></p>
						  <p>All in all, what I'm going for is that the three variables/factors that make great coffee are the processing method, origin or variety and roast style.</p>

                        <div class="card mb-3">
                            <div class="card-body">
                              <h5 class="card-title">Processing method</h5>
                              <p class="card-text">Processing is how the producer removes the soft layers of the fruit from the coffee cherries to remove the seeds aka coffee beans. This process is what effects the flavor most. Thee are other subtler variations on processing but they can be divided into two major categories: washed & natural.</p>
                              <p class="card-text"><small class="text-muted">The washed process excentuates the varietal and origin flavors giving a clean and transparent profile. The natural process, or dry process, may overpower the inherent characteristics of a coffee by adding a dense layer of ripe fruit sweetness.</small></p>

                              <h5 class="card-title">Origin/variety</h5>
                              <p class="card-text">The 2 most common coffee species are Robusta and Arabica. Just like with wine coffee species comes with a wide array of varieties. There are regional flavor profiles and nuances that transform over the years with changing local conditions and soil.</p>
                              <p class="card-text"><small class="text-muted">Brazil has beautiful chocolatey, nutty flavors, whereas Ethiopia has a more citric flavors. Kenya produces flavor profiles such as blackcurrant and wine. Naturally these are some wide generalisations or sneak peaks on what you can find in which area.</small></p>

                              <h5 class="card-title">Roast style</h5>
                              <p class="card-text">Every roaster has a different interpretation of any given coffee variety. To give it more of a lighter roast providing a more elegant profile or a darker roast giving it a more intense, chocolatey flavor. The same coffee would taste completely different!</p>
                              <p class="card-text"><small class="text-muted">The roast style in combination of your style of brewing will make of the final touches of the quality of your coffee. For example an espresso machine would most likely require a darker roast.</small></p>
